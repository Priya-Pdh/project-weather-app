This is weather app and it has the following features:

- Displays the weather data for different cities, where Stockholm is the default when you load the page.
- Displays the five days forecast.
- Background color changes depending on the temperature.
- The weather app also includes geolocation feature and since it takes about 5 seconds to display the user location, we have added a loading spinner.
- We also have included favourite cities which display when clicking the button.
- We included also the search input to search for cities.
- There is also another API endpoint that shows the data of air quality to a specific city.
- There is also some CSS animations for the images in the container.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

- Some of the problems had mainly to do with the merge conflicts and it took up a lot of time.
- For the planning, we used the Trello board and planned the backlog and divided the tasks.
- Tech: Google Meet, Trello, Slack, GitHub
- If we had more time, it would have been nice to add some more CSS animations and make it more advanced when it comes to design.
